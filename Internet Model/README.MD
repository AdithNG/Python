## Description

This project creates a mini model of the internet, demonstrating server creation, connections, and network functionalities through a Python-based program. It allows users to simulate server interactions, including creating servers, establishing connections between them, setting up a home server, and evaluating server responses.

## Usage

The program includes several commands that can be executed within the console:
- **create-server:** Create a server with a specified name and IP address.
- **create-connection:** Establish connections between servers and define connection strengths.
- **set-server:** Set a home server for network simulations.
- **ping:** Calculate and display the response time from the home server to a specified destination.
- **ip-config:** Display the current home server's details.
- **traceroute/tracert:** Trace the path from the home server to a specified destination.
- **display-servers:** Display all servers and their connections.

## Getting Started

To execute the program:
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the 'the_internet.py' file in your preferred Python environment.
3. Follow the prompts in the console to simulate various network actions.

## Notes

The project directory contains text files that include sample inputs to test the functionality of the program. Utilize these text files to check the performance and accuracy of the implemented network functionalities.

Feel free to modify and expand the codebase to explore additional network functionalities and enhance the simulation.
