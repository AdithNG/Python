# Typing Speed Test with Python and Pygame

This Python-based typing speed test application measures your typing speed and accuracy in an engaging and interactive environment.

## Overview

This project utilizes the Pygame library to create a typing speed test application. The user is prompted to type a randomly chosen sentence from the provided text file. Once the user completes typing the sentence, the application calculates various metrics including time taken, accuracy, and words per minute (WPM) to evaluate the user's typing proficiency.

## Features

- **Random Sentences:** Random sentences are chosen from the included text file to keep the test content diverse.
- **Performance Metrics:** The application tracks and displays time taken, accuracy percentage, and WPM upon completion of the typing task.
- **Interactive Interface:** The user interface is interactive, allowing users to input text, reset the test, and view their results.
